Minimo
=======
A simple homepage alternative made with HTML + CSS. [[Live Demo](http://jackosdev.github.io/Minimo-Homepage/)]

Customization
-------------

| File                  | Info |
|-----------------------|------|
| `home.html`           | Edit as you please, if you follow the base you won't have any problems. If you're going to add something, do it **inside** the `main` tags (ie. `<main>your things here</main>`), unless you want it to be out of the main block. |
| `css/theme.css`      | Edit as you please. |
| `css/main.css`        | Be careful with this one. Feel free to edit the `width` on `main {...}` if you don't know what you're doing. |
| `css/main-webkit.css` | Rules for old browsers, a complement to `main.css`. If you have the latest version of your browser or you didn't change any flex rules on `main.css`, ignore it. |

To Do
------
* ~~Add support for old browsers~~ **Done**. I think.
* Add mascots?
* ???
