Downloads
----------
| Version | Description |
|-----------------------|
| **[Basic](https://github.com/JackosDev/Minimo-Homepage/archive/basic.zip)** | Plain HTML + CSS. |
| **[Plus](https://github.com/JackosDev/Minimo-Homepage/archive/master.zip)** | Same as above + jQuery for some fancy effects and functions. |


Customization
--------------
Edit `minimo.config.js` to change the links or edit `index.html` directly (just remember to set `minimoEnableJs = false` if you're using the Plus version).

### Theme
You can create your own theme safely by editing the `theme.css` file.  
The `main.css` file is mostly rules setting the structure.

### Configuration file
- Don't forget the `,` after every `""` and none if is the last one.  
- Use `"---", "---",` to create a new category/list.
- You can disable the configuration file and its features if you want. Just change `minimoEnableJs` to `false`.
